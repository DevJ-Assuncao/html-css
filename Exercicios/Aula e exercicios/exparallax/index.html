                    <p>Metro Manila is the country’s economic, political and cultural capital. And it’s chaotic in the best way possible. From the colourful, roaring jeepneys to the dancing traffic enforcers, to the karaoke machines blasting 80s ballads in the streets, everywhere you go is teeming with life. 
                        Metro Manila is one of Asia’s premier regions. From bamboo-bike tours to artisan shopping, and from contemporary art venues to casinos, the Philippine capital is a world in itself, with something to appeal to all ages and tastes when it comes to things to see and do.
