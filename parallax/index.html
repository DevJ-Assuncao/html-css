                    <p>The city’s olive-green canals and handsome gabled mansions are indeed beautiful, but perhaps above all, it’s the flavour of the city that appeals – its inhabitants a creative and imaginative bunch who quite simply bring the place alight.</p>

                    <p>‘Venice! A magnificent city! A city with an irresistible appeal to the educated, because of its history as well as its present charms.’
                        Venice is one of the most important tourist destinations in the world for its celebrated art and architecture. The city has an average of 50,000 tourists a day and in 2006, it was the world's 28th most internationally visited city, with 2.927 million international arrivals that year.

                    <p>The city is a delightful mix of the old and new — from ancient Spanish churches to gleaming high-rise structures, quaint street stalls and modern shopping malls, historical landmarks to sophisticated, lively bars and restaurants.
                        Makati is the commercial head of the capital and offers a marked contrast, home to smart restaurants and opulent five star hotels and shopping malls such as Rockwell and Greenbelt, which with their quieter walkways among manicured gardens provide cooler havens away from the teeming streets of the city.

                    <p>Porto’s charms are as subtle as the nuances of an aged tawny port, best savoured slowly on a romp through the hilly backstreets of Miragaia, Ribeira and Massarelos. It’s the quiet moments of reflection and the snapshots of daily life that you’ll remember most: the slosh of the Douro against the docks; the snap of laundry drying in river winds; the sound of port glasses clinking; the sight of young lovers discreetly tangled under a landmark bridge, on the rim of a park fountain, in the crumbling notch of a graffiti-blasted wall…</p>
